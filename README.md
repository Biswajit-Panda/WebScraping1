# WebScraping1

This is a very basic web scraping programe using BeautifulSoup.

In this WebScraping I have the scrap from the web site: https://www.moneycontrol.com/markets/indian-indices/
and save in a csv file(data1.csv and data2.csv).

web1.py file contain the code for obtaining header and page contents but it does not filtered.
web2.py file contain the full code for obtaining market price from moneycontrol and save as csv file.
